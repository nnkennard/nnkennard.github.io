* In 2024, I presented a guest lecture at the University of Pittsburgh, in CS1671 (Human Language Technologies). We discussed applications of static word embeddings in Computational Social Science. [Slides](https://github.com/nnkennard/nnkennard.github.io/raw/main/files/nnk_cs1671_slides.pdf)
* In 2023, I presented a short lecture discussing ChatGPT and ELIZA for Exploring Modern Computing, a class at UMass for computer science undergraduates. [Video](https://youtu.be/IRt89NYSXjw) and [slides](https://tinyurl.com/nnk-emc-nlp)
* In 2022, I presented a tutorial for computational social scientists on various aspects of word embeddings as part of
[NLP+CSS 201](https://nlp-css-201-tutorials.github.io/nlp-css-201-tutorials/). [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP9-jF8w13c) and [slides](https://github.com/nnkennard/embedding-tutorial/blob/main/slides.pdf).
* I maintain a github repository ([link](https://github.com/nnkennard/openreview-snippets)) with useful snippets for working with the [OpenReview API](https://docs.openreview.net/getting-started/using-the-api).
