I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at U Mass Amherst, advised by Prof. Andrew McCallum. Previously, I completed my MS in Computer Science at Stanford, advised by Prof. Chris Manning.

My research interests are in Natural Language Processing. I've worked on projects in lexical semantics, evaluating word embeddings, and Natural Language Generation (deep learning-aided and otherwise!)


This is me:
